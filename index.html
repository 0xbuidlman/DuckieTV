<p>DuckieTV is a Google Chrome / Opera extension (Now also available as standalone builds for Windows/Mac/Linux!) that takes care of TV-Show addicts by providing a personalized TV-Show calendar. DuckieTV makes sure the information is always up-to-date and gives you an integrated blocking-resistant torrent search to help you get to the right download as easy as possible.</p>

<p>With the integrated DuckieTorrent client you can connect DuckieTV to your local µTorrent/BitTorrent client and be updated on the download progress without switching applications. Experimental ChromeCast integration even provides the possibility to stream videos to your TV while still downloading.</p>

<p>As of v0.60 DuckieTV also is also finally becoming a worthy SickBeard competitor by introducing an automatic downloading of shows that have aired and translations into 11 languages. (English, Deutch, Español, Français, Italiano, 日本, 한국어, Nederlands, Purtugese, Русский, Svenska, 简体中文 )</p>

<h1>
<a id="permissions" class="anchor" href="#permissions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Permissions</h1>

<p>Chrome will report that this plugin wants to access your data on all websites and read/modify your browser history.</p>

<p>The permissions are actually less scary than they look. Chrome doesn't have the granular permissions system that Android has, so labels can be confusing versus what they're actually used for.</p>

<p><strong>Access your data on all websites</strong></p>

<p>The plugin request permissions to access http://<em>.</em>/ to be able to allow any random mirror to be used for The Pirate Bay and custom trackers in the future. Chrome's extension model requires you to whitelist <em>exactly</em> the urls that you are accessing, which becomes impossible because of this.</p>

<p><strong>Read and modify your browser history</strong></p>

<p>The plugin requests this to use the Chrome.Topsites API that allows to display your most favorite sites on the new tab extension. If you do not wish to give this permission, please use the 'Browser Action' version.</p>

<h1>
<a id="privacy-statement" class="anchor" href="#privacy-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p><strong>I DO NOT WANT YOUR DATA</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The only statistics tracked are the installations by google analytics and visits to the public github site.</li>
<li>As soon you install this plugin it runs locally without sending statistics anywhere. There is no logging from my side of anything you do within this plugin and there never will be.</li>
<li>I do not want your money, I do this in my spare time for fun and to make my own life and that of other's easier. There is no business model.</li>
<li>There are no costs to cover: No servers, no hosting, no databases, everything runs on google's, github's and reddit's infrastructure. Therefore you are <em>not</em> the product and this is extension is free as in free beer.</li>
<li>Everything runs locally. If you decide to execute a torrent search for an episode, a request goes from your computer to the search engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please open a github ticket or start a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/duckietv/">reddit thread</a> if there is anything else that needs improvement. And remember, this is a beta.</p>
