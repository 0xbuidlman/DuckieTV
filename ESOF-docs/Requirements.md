## Introduction
DuckieTV was originally developed as a private project so [SchizoDuckie](https://github.com/SchizoDuckie) could learn AngularJS. Nowadays this project is used to organize and catalogue all the TV shows and movies that the user wants to watch in a calendar. It may also be used to download said movies by indexing torrents from multiple websites.

No acronyms or abbreviation were used in the project.

The author states that DuckieTV,

> is build with Angular.js and Bootstrap.css. On top of that, [some] libraries are used.

## Description
As [DuckieTV](http://schizoduckie.github.io/DuckieTV/?from=duckie.tv/) describes,

> DuckieTV is an application that takes care of TV-Show addicts by providing a personalized TV-Show calendar.

This tool may be integrated directly to local Torrent clients such as Deluge, uTorrent, qBittorrent, Tixati, Transmission and Vuze. This allows the user to keep an eye on the download progress of its torrents without switching to another application.

Another feature that is widely used by its users is the ability to automatically download shows that they have enjoyed as soon as they air.

Additionally the program is available in 14 different languages.

The target market is composed by TV-Show addicts that prefer to see movies at home over buying expensive tickets in a cinema. Previously there was no software that allowed users to organize their favorite shows and downloads in a calendar like DuckieTV does.

There are currently no constraints on using this program, except for countries where the program might be illegal because it uses torrents.

Some libraries are being used in the development.

## Specific Requirements
DuckieTV runs on any browser and any modern Operating System, requiring only that the user has internet access. It runs on external servers provided by

> Google's, GitHub's and Reddit's infrastructure

There are two communication protocols used, BitTorrent (for downloading the shows and movies) and HTTP (to make requests to some websites such as [Open Subtitles](http://api.opensubtitles.org), [TrackTV](https://api-v2launch.trakt.tv/), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) and [Torrent Search Engines](https://github.com/SchizoDuckie/DuckieTV/tree/angular/js/services/TorrentSearchEngines).

### System Features
* Chrome

[DuckieTV](http://schizoduckie.github.io/DuckieTV/?from=duckie.tv/) is a huge fan of Chrome, so DuckieTV can be installed as an extension for this same browser without the need of a standalone version. A **trial version** is available [here](http://duckietv.github.io/DuckieTV/)

* Calendar

The calendar is used to schedule TV-Shows and movies download. In order to be used, the client must have either a local torrent client or a browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.pt/chrome/browser/desktop/). In both cases it also requires an Internet connection.

* Proxy

It is possible to bypass Internet Service Providers (ISP) torrent censorship with DuckieTV. It works by finding mirrors for the target websites that are not currently blocked by them.

* Privacy

Because there is no server side data storage, the user's privacy is kept intact.

> The only statistics tracked for DuckieTV are the visits to the public GitHub site (by Google Analytics) and the installations in the Chrome Webstore.

> As soon you install DuckieTV it runs locally without sending statistics anywhere. There is no server to connect to, no infrastructure to bring down, and no logging from DuckieTVâ€™s side of anything you do within the app, and there never will be.

> Everything runs locally. If you decide to execute a torrent search for an episode, a request goes from your computer to the search engine.

### Perfomance Requirements

### Design Constraints
DuckieTV was developed in order to fit different screen dimensions, however it only runs on desktop or laptop computers, it is not compatible with mobile devices.
Since it is a JavaScript application, its design is only limited by modern CSS's limitations.
