Seriesguide Chrome v2
=====================

Manage your favorite TV series and movies from your browser's new tab page
Keep track of your progress in all the series you're watching and movies you want to watch in a souped up 'new tab' page.

Allows you to browse through all your favorite series, view the schedule, and show series information.
On top of that, it allows you to search The Pirate Bay (and others, in the future) when an episode has aired to find magnet links leading to it.

It comes in 2 flavours:
* 'New Tab mode': Installs itself as your new tab page  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hkbamkappmgfjjahmnlngibomenmbbdf/
* 'Browser Action mode': Adds a button next to your address bar https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdfkaloficjmdjbgmckaddgfcghgidei/
