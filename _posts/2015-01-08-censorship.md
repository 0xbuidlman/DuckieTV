# DuckieTV hates censorship

#### Blocking-resistant, multiple torrent-search engines built-in

DuckieTV tries to make it as simple as possible to bypass the silly censorship laws laid down by people and corporations that do not understand how people want to consume their content these days. 

If your country has implemented any IP or DNS blocking rules, automated mirror-resolving code will try to find a working copy of a well known torrent sites.

When this is the case, consider adopting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anti+censorship+proxy" target="_blank">one of the many proxy services</a> to protect your privacy.
