## Project Description

Duckie Tv is a program for TV and movie enthusiasts with the goal of helping you track down your favorite series and films alongside a customized calendar. By now it has been extended to also help you find safe and updated torrent links for you to download and watch your episodes. All of this is available on the great majority of platforms.
The project was originally created by “SchizoDuckie” as an AngularJS learning project, but scaled into a collaboration project with over 300.000 code lines committed by 4 main collaborators and reviewed mostly by themselves, too. In spite of having reached a much bigger size than originally planned for, the developers still maintain the original working philosophy: 
> In the end DuckieTV is a project that was built for fun by people in their free time so working on it should be as fun as possible.


## Software Development Process

DuckieTV does not have any specifically defined Software Development Process, as the author explains,
> Things aren’t prototyped, mostly not even sketched out but are just ideas or concepts that grow in our minds.
This, however, doesn’t mean some development guidelines aren’t followed. In fact, DuckieTV’s development follows Agile pretty strictly, never enforcing any particular stage to be ready before continuing with the next one, as you would see in a Waterfall process. Being, at least partially, a community-created product, there are “often many things are being worked at at the same time” which results in a release early, release often methodology. 
However, as an incremental development and delivery project without a clearly defined structure, some problems tend to arrive, as Schizo explains: “[Sometimes] we have to hide some in-progress stuff to get a release out”. This waste of time doesn’t seem to concern the team too much, because it saves them the hassle of worrying whether they are following the guidelines, allowing them a larger maneuvering space and more freedom. In fact, the team admits to prefer re-factoring incomplete ideas when it’s obvious they’ll become core features of DuckieTV over pre-emptively planning them (“It's okay if the initial implementation of something is a somewhat hacky job, as long as things … get refactored into something reusable when they touch multiple parts of the app”).
